## Project Overview

The Twitter Clone API enables users to:
- Register and log in securely using **JWT authentication**
- Follow and unfollow other users
- Create, like, and reply to tweets
- View tweet feeds, followers, and following lists

This project is designed to simulate the backend of a social media application, providing all necessary endpoints to support user interactions and tweet management.

## Features

- User Registration and Login with **JWT-based authentication**
- CRUD operations for tweets, likes, and replies
- Follow/unfollow functionality
- Secure endpoint access with **middleware** for authentication and error handling
- Testing and debugging facilitated with **HTTP Client** using `.http` files

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **SQLite** for database management
- **JWT** for secure authentication
- **HTTP Client (.http files)** for API testing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/twitter-clone-api.git
   cd twitter-clone-api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the SQLite database:
   - Ensure `twitterClone.db` is in the root directory.

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Environment Variables
